## **Motivation:**

In human organizations, those who are in positions of power can, and have the incentive to, leverage on their power to increase the likelihood of remaining in power. This is an emergent phenomenon, inherent to most forms of democracy, known as [Incumbent Advantage](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/06/11/154745966/why-its-good-to-be-the-incumbent) and it is well known and [documented](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=incumbent+advantage&ia=web) in political science. Incumbent Advantage tends to degenerate into cartel and, eventually, ruling elites formation; the ultimate form of centralization. 

 One of the most pernicious incentives coming from incumbent advantage appears when elected leaders are responsible for budget allocation. In this case, the incentive for bribery; both passive (initiated by public officials) and active (initiated by bidders) is enormous. Bribery compromises safety and quality by enabling unqualified or corrupt contractors to secure contracts, resulting in substandard infrastructure that poses risks (collapsing bridges or deteriorating roads in the physical world). Bribery inflates project costs through kickbacks and rigged bids, diverting scarce public funds from essential services and exacerbating inequality, particularly for marginalized communities dependent on reliable public goods.
 
Bribery, in any form, is one of the diseases that has plagued all kinds of democracy all over the world.  

[Rational Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance) is another  weakness of regular, representative democracy. It refers to a decision, an individual may take, to remain uninformed about something because the cost of acquiring the information (in terms of time, effort, or money) outweighs the perceived benefit of having that knowledge. This concept is often applied in economics, political science and [choice theory](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/34674/chapter-abstract/295454387?redirectedFrom=fulltext), particularly in [voting behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance#In_politics).

In the case of the Cardano ecosystem, the effects of Rational Ignorance are mitigated by the delegation system. However, this has the unintended consequence of amplifying Incumbent Advantage. This is because, by its very nature, delegation removes the incentive of delegators to verse themselves in the nuances of the ecosystem. Given that knowledge is power, this increases the relative power difference between delegators and delegates. This power difference is then further amplified by other factors such as name recognition and the emergence of support networks whose information flow can easily be affected by the incumbent. The more advantage the incumbents gets, the more susceptible the system becomes to centralization.

Centralization of power in itself isn't a bad thing; centralization of power tied with lack of effective accountability is. Thence, we propose a solution in which every bit of power, any entity has within a community, is **almost constantly** legitimized while Incumbent Advantage and Rational Ignorance are both significantly reduced.


## **Considerations on R.E.S.P.E.C.T**
*Respect* means to value someone or something. You can respect the property of others. You can respect the work other people do. Even if you don’t respect the character qualities of a person, you can still respect what they produce.

Consider the act of serving the poor in a soup kitchen. This act is generally respected. The person who volunteers is generally respected for their service. However, if the server is paid to feed the poor, then the respect is typically accrued to the donor who paid the server rather than the individual providing the service.

We value people. We respect their talents, their character, and their honesty. We respect them just for being alive, and we respect their potential. This is non-transferable respect. A person can eat healthy, train, and pursue personal growth. This may increase the amount of non-transferrable respect one person has for another. A person can also lie, cheat, and steal and lose non-transferrable respect. This kind of respect can also be viewed as reputation.  More accurately, we value (aka respect) someone because of their reputation.

That said, money can be viewed as a measure of respect someone has earned for past contributions to a community. We value money because others value money. Money is therefore respected. When money transfers hands, one person loses this measure of community respect and another person gains it. When you sell a product that someone in the community values, you earn respect. Note that all “property”, of any form, is a measure of respect. Theft of “property” is a form of disrespect. Property and “ownership” are simply ideas that express a peace treaty among cooperative beings to end the war of all against all under the law of the jungle where might makes right. Respecting the idea of property is therefore respecting others.

#### Community ℝespect
We propose to empower a test community to reach a consensus on the *merits* of each individual’s contributions and rewards them with the ℝespect they are due. In this case, ℝespect is synonymous with community money or currency.

Most countries have their own money and regardless of what name they give to their money, it is still money. BTC and ETH are the “ℝespect” of their respective communities. Here, each test community, which we call a ƒractal, will have its own form of ℝespect.

Free market prices are one means of discovering the relative ℝespect (value) for various goods and services. For example, you may own a stock that has a certain value (measured in ℝespect or money); however, other people can reach a new consensus that the stock is worthless. This change in community opinion does not constitute “theft”, as the value of the stock isn’t the “property” of the owner of the stock.

Someone might say that while the value of the stock isn’t property, the stock itself is still property. However, stock ownership, like all property, is a matter of consensus *opinion*. Did you acquire the stock fairly? Did you honor all of your agreements with respect to the stock? Who gets to decide these things? Is it not just a consensus opinion? In this case, the consensus is that the government, as elected, gets to decide. In other words, all titles to all things are in fact a consensus opinion. If the consensus opinion changed, you would find it difficult to retain control of your things.

ℝespect is the real currency of the people, by the people, and for the people. The distribution of ℝespect is the collective opinion of the community. No one is entitled to ℝespect and the community is free to change its opinion at will (through a respectable process). ℝespect cannot be stolen because no one, not even governments, can change a community’s opinion against its collective will. 

#### Companies vs DAOs 
Traditional companies and organizations are operated by a board of directors elected by shareholders. The shareholders are Pareto-distributed which means, typically, 1% of shareholders effectively control 51% of the voting rights and 51% of the voting rights is often enough to convey 100% of control. Furthermore, most day-to-day decisions are delegated from the board to a single CEO who sits on top of a pyramid of power.

A DAO turns the power upside down and gives it to the employees/customers. In the case of Bitcoin, miners make objective contributions and the work produced is judged objectively based upon the difficulty in finding a hash. The tokens, aka Bitcoin, have no voting rights. In the present proposal a **ƒractal**, replaces objective proof of work with subjective proof of work. Prior attempts at creating DAOs used token-weighted voting which caused them to mirror a corporate structure. ƒractals are different: their ℝespect is more like Bitcoin  the more the contributors work and produce value respected by other contributors, the more ℝespect they earn.

## **Proposed protocol**
### **Budget allocation**
##### 1. Attend meetings
We propose to reward those who are proactive in doing things for the community. This effort is then recognized and accounted for after the fact. Is there something you think you can contribute to a community? Go for it and you can start earning the ℝespect you deserve. Once you join a community that shares your values, you can immediately start earning the ℝespect of your community by simply attending a 1-hour video conference and reaching a consensus with five other randomly selected community members. Whether you are a developer, marketer, blogger, YouTuber, event organizer, graphic designer, networker, lawyer, CEO, doctor, priest, or farmer, there is a place for you to contribute to a ƒractal community. The more a community values your contributions, the more ℝespect you earn.

##### 2. Your opinion matters
Every week you get to share your opinion with 5 random members and get a say over how the community collectively respects their contributions. Over time everyone in the community gets to hear what you respect. Everyone has an incentive to negotiate with you in weekly meetings because 4 out of 6 people agree or no one earns ℝespect.

The idea of a weekly meeting is similar to the standup meetings held by many companies. All employees are used to attending weekly meetings and expect to get paid for doing so. It is no different with members of a ƒractal.

The purpose of the weekly meeting is to build consensus on the rank-order value of each individual's contribution to the ƒractal’s cause. Rank-order means sorting from greatest to least. 4 out of 6 or 3 out of 5 must agree or no one earns anything.

The highest ranked individual from each of the groups is sent to the next round where the process is repeated in a ƒractal manner (aka ƒractally). This process is repeated up to 5 times or until there are less than 6 people in a round. This, of course, depends on the size of the community. 

##### 3. Presenting Work & Reaching Consensus
In each meeting, people are given a 5 minute time slot to present their contributions. After all presentations are made, the group has 25-30 minutes to debate on how to rank each member from highest to lowest. The ranking, however is done by each individual. So, in a group of 6 people, each participant will end up with 5 rankings, one coming from each of his peers. 

The average of these 5 values will be the final score of that participant for that week. Consequently, in a group of 6 people, 6 final scores will be obtained. This sorted tuple is the outcome from that group, for that week. 

At no point in time during the meeting, any participant is allowed to rank himself, neither for good nor bad. His job, during this one hour meeting is to act as an observer and asses the work of his peers. Even if he didn't do anything else during that week for the community and he is ranked last, the community still recognizes and values this job. So he still receives whatever ℝespect corresponds to the ranking he gets, even if it's the last one. 

Once consensus is reached, all members report to the blockchain.  Anyone who wasn’t part of the video call and any automated systems would not know how to report in. 

At the end of each call, members can rate their experience with the other members. Members who monopolize the call by talking too much, or are combative, rude, etc. should receive a low rating. Members who are friendly, polite, courteous, and pleasant to work with should get a high ranking. Over time everyone will be rated by everyone else and these ratings multiple times. *So, by the law of large numbers from probability theory, the rankings of all individuals should converge to the correct and fair values.* 

#### **Group size**
In a paper titled *“Group Discussion as Interactive Dialogue or as Serial Monologue: The Influence of Group Size”*, Nicolas Fay, Simon Garrod, and Jean Carletta studied the impact of group size on communication patterns. They identify two kinds of communication: dialog and monologue. In a dialog, members of a group discussion are likely to be most influenced by those with whom they interact, whereas in a monologue they are likely to be most influenced by the dominant speaker.

This paper indicates that increasing group sizes beyond 5 tends to increase the likelihood of a monolog style discussion. Therefore, to maximize the influence of individual group members, group sizes of 5-6 people are ideal

#### **Schedule**
All groups in a round meet at the same time. This prevents one person from having multiple accounts and attending multiple meetings. The community governance process determines the schedule for the meetings.
#### **Respect Distribution**
We propose a fixed emission 1000 ℝespect tokens at each meeting time. These tokens shall be distributed pro-rata, according to the scores participants get as specified in the following tables. 

**ROUND 1**

| Member contribution rank        | Points earned |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Level 1 (Least contribution)    | 2             |
| Level 2                         | 3             |
| Level 3                         | 5             |
| Level 4                         | 8             |
| Level 5                         | 13            |
| Level 6 (Greatest contribution) | 21            |

**ROUND 2**

|                                  | Points earned |             |              |     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | --- |
| Member contribution rank         | Current round | Prior round | Net increase |     |
| Level 6 (Least contribution)     | 21            | 21          | 0            |     |
| Level 7                          | 34            | 21          | 13           |     |
| Level 8                          | 55            | 21          | 34           |     |
| Level 9                          | 89            | 21          | 68           |     |
| Level 10                         | 144           | 21          | 123          |     |
| Level 11 (Greatest contribution) | 233           | 21          | 212          |     |

In the event any group fails to reach a consensus, they receive ℝespect based upon the consensus of the last group in which they were able to reach consensus. In other words, instead of 5 of the 6 people being promoted from Rank 11 to Ranks 12-16, everyone would remain at Rank 11. Consensus failure in the first round results in a Rank of 0 and no ℝespect earned.

#### **Council**
So far, we have looked at part of the process of allocating a community budget, but some actions require global consensus. Things such as updating community guidelines or the community smart contract need to be decided by the people as a whole.

The $n$ members with the highest average RESPECT over the last $X$ weeks form the **council**. Meaning that those members who have been recently most respected become the decision-makers. Here:

$$ n = ln(N)^2 $$

Where:
- $n$: Number of members in the Council
- N: Average number of attendees to the last $X$ meetings.
- $X$: Parameter decided by each fractal depending on the needs either for stability, adaptability, change, etc.  

**Governance Roles:** The council holds special privileges, including the ability to manage the treasury, oversee community membership and other roles that can be taken from already existing forms of DGov. 
#### Ultimatum game
There is a well-known economic experiment known as the Ultimatum Game5. In this experiment, one person is given $100 and asked to share some part of it with another player. The other player then has the option to accept or reject the offer. If the offer is rejected then neither player gets to keep the money. If it is accepted then both players get to keep it. In numerous experiments, it was found that offers below $30 were routinely rejected even though $30 is better than nothing. The actual results varied from culture to culture which indicates that ƒractals will likely work best when composed of people from a similar culture.

When asking a group of people to reach a consensus or get nothing, we face a similar problem. If you put six people in a room and all of them believe they have made equal contributions to a community, then they are likely to reject any consensus where they get significantly less than someone else. By following the Fibonacci sequence, any two consecutively ranked contributors agree to a 38/62 split in the award and are therefore likely to reach consensus even if they both feel a 50/50 split would be fairer. The more stubborn individual would likely get 62%. Furthermore, the group winner receives about 40% while the rest, the runner-ups, collectively get 60%. This means that if you can view the runner-ups as one logical person agreeing to the proposed split and the winner as being asked to accept or reject, the winner would still accept even if no one else did anything to deserve their compensation.

In a hypothetical situation where all members contributed an objectively equal amount, they would have to decide between everyone getting nothing or allowing others to get more. Chances are they would find some basis, perhaps even random chance, to reach a consensus on the order rather than everyone getting nothing. Over multiple iterations of this process, the community should correct for any past imbalances.

The principles behind ƒractally are outlined in the book, “*More Equal Animals - The subtle art of true democracy*”. The core idea is to define a process to measure the wisdom of the crowds. 

Also, several extracts to this document were literally taken from the fractally white paper authored by Daniel Larimer, James Mart and the Fractally team. I didn't bother to take the time to modify those parts because they were already carefully written, so no extra work was needed; Also, in his book "_More Equal Animals_", Daniel Larimer himself opposes the excessive focus on copyrights as a damaging influence for the common good.
